            One is always on a strange road, watching strange scenery and
            listening to strange music. Then one day, you will find that the
            things you try hard to forget are already gone.

            Happiness is not about being immortal nor having food or rights in
            one's hand. It’s about having each tiny wish come true, or having
            something to eat when you are hungry or having someone's love when
            you need love.

            Fight, and you may die. Run, and you'll live at least a while. And
            dying in your beds many years from now. Would you be willing to
            trade? All the days from this day to that, for one chance, just one
            chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take
            our lives, but they'll never take our Freedom!
