        When tomorrow turns in today, yesterday, and someday that no more important in your memory, we suddenly realize that we r pushed forward by time.

        stop pacing the aisles and counting the miles. Instead, climb more mountains, eat more ice cream, go barefoot more often, swim more rivers, watch more sunsets, laugh more, cry less. Life must be lived as we go along. The station will come soon enough.

        I dont think that when people grow up, they will become more broad-minded and can accept everything. Conversely, I think its aselecting process, knowing whats the most important and whats the least. And then be a simple man

        The woods arose in folds, like drapery of awakened mountains, stately with a depth of awe, and memory of the tempests. Autumns mellow hand was upon them, as they owned already, touched with gold and red and olive, and their joy towards the sun was less to a bridegroom than a father.
